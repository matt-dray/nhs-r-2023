::: {.notes}
* What do we mean by 'base' R?
* It's actually several packages that are automatically installed (including one called 'base').
* Some are automatically attached when you start R. You can see this if you look at `sessionInfo()`.
* Some others are considered base, but not attached. These have priority 'base' when you look at the output of `installed.packages()`.
* There are also some non-base packages that have a special status: 'recommended'.

## Stability {background-image="images/00-rgui-menu-dark.png" background-position="top" background-size="100%"}

::: {.notes}
* Base packages have changed very little over time.
* Base code created 10 years ago has a pretty good chance of running today.
:::

## Dependency {background-image="images/00-rgui-menu-dark.png" background-position="top" background-size="100%"}

::: {.notes}
* Using packages in your work can help make your life a lot easier.
* But you have to consider that dependencies can cause problems; packages and functions come and go.
* An understanding of base can get around some of this.

## Modern (!) {background-image="images/00-rgui-menu-dark.png" background-position="top" background-size="100%"}

* base pipe
* placeholder
* lambda
* string literals

::: {.notes}
* Stable and dependable, yes, but that doesn't mean it never advances.
* The pipe, developed in the {magrittr} package by Stefan Milton-Bache and popularised by the tidyverse, has come to base R.
* It's been followed by a placeholder to pass the LHS to the non-first argument on the RHS.
* A shorthand anonymous function, or 'lambda', has been introduced.

## {pixeltrix} [`r fontawesome::fa("github")`](https://github.com/matt-dray/pixeltrix) {background-image="images/00-rgui-menu-dark.png" background-position="top" background-size="100%"}

`locator()`, `repeat`

<TODO: add gif.>

::: {.notes}
* I want to show you three packages I've written for fun that include interesting base R functions.
* The first is the {pixeltrix}, a package for creating blocky pixel art, like you might see on retro videogames.
* It works thanks to `locator()`, a curious base function that lets you click a point on a plot and have its coordinates returned.
* {pixeltrix} contains a `repeat` loop, that asks the user to click on a plot with `locator()`; updates the plot given the click; and then re-asks the user to click until they break the `repeat` loop.

## {r.oguelike} [`r fontawesome::fa("github")`](https://github.com/matt-dray/r.oguelike) {background-image="images/00-rgui-menu-dark.png" background-position="top" background-size="100%"}

`readline()`, `matrix()`, `while`

<TODO: add gif.>

::: {.notes}
* {r.oguelike} mimics an early text-based videogame. 
* It uses base R functions to procedurally build a tile-based dungeon, which is stored in a `matrix()` and queried with `which()` to identify the locations of characters. The player is `@` and the enemy is `E`. There's an inventory where gold can be stored, along with apples, `a`, that restore a health gauge.
* The user can move their character (represented by the `@` symbol) by typing into the interactive prompt, which is provided by the base function `readline()`. The enemy tracks the player.

## {tamRgo} [`r fontawesome::fa("github")`](https://github.com/matt-dray/tamRgo) {background-image="images/00-rgui-menu-dark.png" background-position="top" background-size="100%"}

`R_user_dir()`

<TODO: add gif.>

::: {.notes}
* {tamRgo} simulates a cyber pet that lives on your computer and 'exists' between R sessions.
* How can data about your pet exist between sessions? The package makes use of the base R function `R_user_dir()`, which builds a path to a standardised location on the user's computer where data or cached items can be stored. In {tamRgo}, a 'blueprint' text file stores the pet's status. The blueprint is read at the start of the next R session and values related to time, such as the pet's age and hunger level, are updated given the difference between the current date and date of last interaction.
